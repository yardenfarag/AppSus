The rain continued to beat against the windshield like the footsteps of some unseen thing.

He slowly made his way to the front of the car, his hand shaking as he reached for the flashlight. He shone the light around and saw that he had hit a deer. The deer was still alive, and Phillip felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He knew he should put the deer out of its misery, but he`,

Her team was about to run onto the field to take on their opponents, 10 to 6 in their favor with an end in sight. My daughter and her teammates screamed and took off. With me running a few steps behind, I saw a large black man, bald and ten feet tall, in the back row of the stands, holding my neighbor's four year old waving her toward him. I was amazed.

        The second time was much earlier, one sunny morning, as a baby's rattle cascaded over the benches in the park across the street from our house. I looked up to see Nico, now a man, ten years older than when I had last seen him. He was catching sunrays, his eyes closed and a smile on his face.
        
        I never saw Nico again, but he has been in my life in some way every day for the past 35 years.`,

        One day, a young girl discovered a magical kingdom hidden inside a tree. She climbed up the tree and found herself in a beautiful land full of friendly animals and wonderful flowers. The girl explored the kingdom for hours, and when she tired, she curled up in a bed of soft leaves and fell asleep. When she awoke, she found herself back in her own room, with the tree outside her window. She knew she would never forget her magical adventure and would always treasure the memories.

He had made it the last few miles, but was now in the throes of a full-blown panic attack. His breaths came in short gasps and his heart was pounding so hard, it felt like it was trying to escape his chest. He pulled to the side of the road, scattering gravel, and tried to calm himself. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths before starting the car. He crept along the road, his car the only light in a wide and dark world. The rain continued to beat against the windshield like the footsteps of some unseen thing.

        Suddenly, the car was thrust forward and Phillip yelped. His car had hit something, but he couldn't see what it was. He put the car in park and got out, his heart pounding. He slowly made his way to the front of the car, his hand shaking as he reached for the flashlight. He shone the light around and saw that he had hit a deer.
