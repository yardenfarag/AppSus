Her team was about to run onto the field to take on their opponents, 10 to 6 in their favor with an end in sight. My daughter and her teammates screamed and took off. With me running a few steps behind, I saw a large man, bald and ten feet tall, in the back row of the stands, holding my neighbor's four year old waving her toward him. I was amazed.
            The second time was much earlier, one sunny morning, as a baby's rattle cascaded over the benches in the park across the street from our house. With baby Cameron held up to me, I saw his father out and about in the streets of Detroit on a bright, red Vespa, catching the eye of a young woman.
            I never saw Nico again, but he has been in my life in some way every day for the past 35 years. `,

I switched off my alarm and silently made my way to the living room, where I found my mother and sister watching tv. We exchanged brief conversation and soon enough I was out the door, caught up in the morning crowd. I was one of the lucky ones, I thought, when I saw the sidewalk completely covered in snow. I loved the winter. As I watched the snowflakes lazily fall through the air, I wanted to grab one.`,

        I miss talking to you and hearing about your life. I feel like we used to be really close, but then we just drifted apart. I guess that happens sometimes. But I really would like to reconnect and get back to where we were.

        Long time no talk! I hope you're doing well. I've been meaning to write to you for a while now, but I've just been so busy. Anyway, I'm finally sitting down to write this email and catch up with you.
        
        So, what's new with you? I've been keeping busy with work and spending time with family and friends. I recently went on a trip to the beach with some friends and it was so much fun. The weather was perfect and we had a great time just relaxing and enjoying each other's company.
        
        I'm really looking forward to the rest of the summer. I have a few more trips planned and I can't wait to just relax and enjoy some time off. I hope you have some fun plans too!

        I have been thinking a lot about us lately, and I feel like there is something missing. I can't put my finger on it, but I just feel like something is not right. I know you are busy with work and everything, but I just feel like we don't spend enough time together.
        
        I don't know, I just wanted to talk to you about it and see what you think. I love you, and I just want to make sure that we are okay. I hope to hear from you soon.

He had made it the last few miles, but was now in the throes of a full-blown panic attack. His breaths came in short gasps and his heart was pounding so hard, it felt like it was trying to escape his chest. He pulled to the side of the road, scattering gravel, and tried to calm himself. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths before starting the car. He crept along the road, his car the only light in a wide and dark world. The rain continued to beat against the windshield like the footsteps of some unseen thing.

        Suddenly, the car was thrust forward and Phillip yelped. His car had hit something, but he couldn't see what it was. He put the car in park and got out, his heart pounding. He slowly made his way to the front of the car, his hand shaking as he reached for the flashlight. He shone the light around and saw that he had hit a deer. The deer was still alive, and Phillip felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He knew he should put the deer out of its misery, but he`,

When she awoke, she found herself back in her own room, with the tree outside her window. She knew she would never forget her magical adventure and would always treasure the memories.
